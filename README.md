# Mixin Conflict Helper

![preview](https://i.imgur.com/vjaBDCW.png)

This mod catches injection exceptions when two mixins conflict. It finds the culprits and displays
a user-friendly GUI, explaining the problem and providing buttons to report the issue to the mod's
issues page.

Once interacted with, the game crashes as usual.
